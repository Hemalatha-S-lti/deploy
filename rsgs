MoM - 10-Oct-2025:
 
Semantic Search:
Have more data added
UI must be more professional - enterprise level app
Give a user friendly message - it must be self explanatory
Wider text box - easy for user to type
Add color to the UI
 
Voice Search:
Good, liked the UI
Change to card format - instead of json
Add clear button
Add 2 options (boxes) like text search and voice search
Same UI for both
Make UI more user friendly
 
PPT:
Basic info
Easy and simple
Don't dump too much info - Less theory and more demo

End to end Application (semantic and voice search) developed and deployed in Azure
Kindly do have a look and review
 
changes that were pointed out during the standup will be incorporated before tomorrow 3pm 
TodoAPP
 
My suggestion to keep UI for voice search and just enable option to add /modify the text in search textbox.  So that user can do both operations from same UI.
 
 
You can add basic data validations like . check if textbox empty or minimum text size required etc .
 
Also some interesting tagline for UI can make it more interactive. like .  "Semantic intelligence for workforce discovery."  , "Semantic search that knows what you mean." etc.
