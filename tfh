UG Subjects (Basics):

Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA): Learned how to organize data efficiently and solve problems using algorithms.

Operating Systems (OS): Understood how computers manage resources, memory, and processes.

Database Management Systems (DBMS): Learned to store, retrieve, and manage data using SQL.

Computer Architecture (CA): Basics of how a computer works, including processors, memory, and instruction flow.

Software Engineering (SE): Learned software development lifecycle, designing, and testing applications.

Soft Skills: Improved communication, teamwork, and professional skills.

PG Subjects (Basics):

Edge Computing: Processing data near the source to reduce latency and improve efficiency.

Artificial Intelligence (AI): Basics of making machines “intelligent” to perform tasks.

Machine Learning (ML): Teaching computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions.

Large Language Models (LLM): Understanding AI models that can process and generate human-like text.


Artificial Intelligence (AI): “It’s making machines think and act like humans to perform tasks intelligently, such as recognizing images or understanding language.”

Machine Learning (ML): “A subset of AI where computers learn patterns from data and improve automatically without being explicitly programmed.”

Large Language Models (LLM): “Advanced AI models trained on huge amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language, like chatbots or text summarizers.”

Edge Computing: “Processing data close to where it is generated, instead of sending it all to a central server, which makes systems faster and more efficient.”

💡 Tip for saying it naturally:

Keep each explanation 1–2 sentences.

If he asks for examples, you can quickly mention:

AI → self-driving cars

ML → recommendation systems

LLM → ChatGPT or voice assistants

Edge Computing → smart cameras or IoT devices

I am passionate about classical dance and have completed my Rangapravesham in Bharatanatyam. I also teach students, which helps me develop patience, discipline, and the ability to guide others—skills that I find valuable in both personal and professional life."
